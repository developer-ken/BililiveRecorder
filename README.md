# BiliBili Stream Recorder

这个版本用我蹩脚的代码添加了弹幕录制功能、、
目前我自己在用，不建议使用这个版本（说不定哪里就有BUG）
建议转到原作者的版本[Bililive/BililiveRecorder](https://github.com/Bililive/BililiveRecorder)

[简体中文 | Simplified Chinese](README_CN.md)

## Apology

GitHub is a global platform, and theoretically, everyone should use English. But since this project is only meant for Chinese user and rely on a Chinese website [BiliBili](https://live.bilibili.com) (_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili)_), all code comments are in Chinese. This README file will always use English so people like _you_ can understand what is this, and perhaps make some use out of it.

## Install & Use

See [rec.danmuji.org](https://rec.danmuji.org) (in Chinese)

## Feature

- Easy to use
- Reset timestamp to start from 0
- Writes duration info automatically when recoding session ends.
- Start recording when stream starts
- Record multiple stream at same time
- Pure C#, no native dependency like ffmpeg
- Open source!

## Develop & Getting Started

**Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Core** and **PowerShell** is required. Visual Studio 2019 *could* work but is not tested.

Some file are generated by [PreComplie Script](./CI/patch_buildinfo.ps1). Build project to clear errors shown by Visual Studio.

Project | Type | Note
:---:|:---:|:---
BililiveRecorder.WPF | .NET Framework 4.6.2
BililiveRecorder.Core | .NET Standard 2.0
BililiveRecorder.FlvProcessor | .NET Standard 2.0
BililiveRecorder.Server | .NET Core 2.0 | TODO

You can start poking around from...

- `BililiveRecorder.WPF/MainWindow.xaml` about WPF gui
- `BililiveRecorder.Core/Recorder.cs` about core record logic
- `BililiveRecorder.FlvProcessor/FlvStreamProcessor.cs` about FLV data process
